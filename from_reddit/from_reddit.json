France should be getting additional units from Italy which you might be able to encourage them to use to stab England with (although tbh in this position with 5 English fleets I think it's going to be too difficult to attack England). The more credible plan I think would involve working with England where after you start attacking Italy or something England stabs France and you race for the solo. France should be badly out of position after they take Italy's centres so England might be able to pick up one or two French ones from behind offsetting any gains they get, and making a devastating stab.",

Budapest and much of the east is not holdable so that will bring you back down to 16 but with good play, and just grind you can break through in the West and I think still win.\n\nTo be able to break in the west the first important thing is to be able to take MAO and that you can do for although you are evenly matched in terms of fleets with France you can tap Brest and cut any support thereby guaranteeing yourself to get into the province unless of course France decides to go to MAO via Brest but that is very risky for him, but is a guess. This is what we diplomacy players like to call an unstable stalemate whereby France is currently stalemating you there but can only continue the stalemate through said guess. Defend against the triple support attack into MAO by risking Brest or betting you would attack Brest and defend.\n\nGiven you are beginners I would go with the attack into MAO triple support for now, but whatever France does even if he does outguess you this turn, in subsequent turns you will eventually be able to win by just percentage. 50% shot you get it right compounded over so many turns becomes impossible for France to hold.\n\nOnce then you take MAO it becomes a HIGHLY unstable undefensible position for France and then you can very easily take Brest, or exploit your position by going to Naf and follow into Brest again. Or you can even try for Portugal. In short France cannot hold this and you will make progress.\n\nTo a certain degree the same is true with Burgundy, you have three units on Burgundy and using Pic can tap Paris and force Burgundy. Although Burgundy can then retreat to Gascony and still support hold Paris being in MAO you can tap Gascony and also thereby secure Paris..... BUT Not quite, this is something to look out for but I find currently to be a bit impossible given the German unit in Tyrol as he can either walk into Munich or well tap Munich and cut any support you do but still if you have nothing to do . But that is where we should now focus our attention on the east.\n\nYou can as I explained breakthrough in the west the only question now is how do you prevent complete collapse in the east..... Well I am sorry to admit this but you can't. Eventually with good play Budapest Romania and Sevastopol will fall, but that does not mean your game is over, on the contrary. There is a stalemate line that runs from Moscow to Warsaw to Munich through Silesia that you can hold with a few units albeit you do need more than that which you have here. If you are able to delay them long enough you can possibly set up said stalemate line, only issue is that it takes up 6 units. Berlin support hold Silesia, Prussia or Livonia support hold Warsaw, Livonia or St. Petersburg support hold Moscow. Thus you NEED more armies in the east. Convoy your Edinburgh army to Norway to take it to St. Petersburg, and convoy the London army to Kiel and move Kiel-Baltic whereby you need to convoy Kiel again to Livonia. ALSO as mentioned you cannot hold Budapest you must retreat to preserve your armies in the east so that there are no force disbands. You can suffer disbands through your fleets. Even if you are not able to get all said 6 units to said defensive line you can get enough units to make it very hard for them to break through. Meanwhile make sure you DO NOT LOSE MUNICH. They could for example rush it now and there is not much you can do to stop it but being beginners I am not too sure they would realize its critical value. If anything and you need the Kiel army you just convoyed from London to Kiel to defend Munich more than defending the east DO THAT.\n\nFinal note regarding the east, you may not need all those units to stalemate, it is just incase worst case scenario and they have an army in Bohemia, Galicia, Ukraine and Sevastopol, especially since Germany cannot build new armies and two of France's units in the east are fleets. So my tldr summary on the east, you cannot hold what you currently have but beyond those three centers you can hold them off or make it take them several years to break through in the east if you are not able to set up a full stalemate line as you will have a partial stalemate line and still hard to deal with.\n\nTHIS is where your victory comes. As said if you are able to do this in the east, then let's do the calculations you will be at 14 centers, now you may think that is worse, but not really for in the meanwhile you will be progressing in the west. Let me go back to stalemate lines for a bit.\n\nDiplomacy has a main stalemate line that runs from St. Petersburg to North Africa evenly splitting the board between east and west 17 vs 17. If you are set up on this line it is impossible to break through on the other side of the line with expert play. As mentioned though this is the MAIN stalemate line but not the only one, another one for example was that which I was explaining in Moscow and Warsaw. By just holding these two centers you have a foothold in the east and all you need to do is take your centers in the west, something that you can do but will take a WHILE of grinding first with MAO, then you can take Brest get to Naf etc. You lose three sure, but then all you need is Brest Paris Marseilles and one more.....\n\n* &#x200B;\n\nNow that is how you CAN win, but this is not guaranteed first you need to make sure you make faster progress in the west then lose progress in the east before they send units west and set up a new defensive line. Second there are a few such as said similar stalemate lines like the Warsaw Moscow stalemate line I described to you in the Spain Marseilles area that is the same exact idea just a foothold in the west, but it is possible just hard to predict that far in the future as there are a LOT of guesses to go though I must admit you just said they are beginners so may be VERY hard for them to see this so that is another advantage you have going for you now, but that is the general strategy you need to do to get the upper hand.\n\nWith that in mind I recommend this be your turn and moves for this phase.\n\nF NAO-MAOF IRI s NAO-MAOF ENG s NAO-MAOA Pic-BreA Lon-KieF NTH C A Lon-KieF HEL C A Lon-KieF Kie-BalA Bel-BurA Ruh s A MunA Mun s A Bel-BurF Ber HA Ukr-WarA Rum-UkrA Bud-RumA Sev s Bud-Rum\n\nExplanation. I explained the convoy to Kiel, next turn convoy to Norway. I explained the story with MAO, guess story I am guessing this should go through or try something to attack Brest, you NEED to break through before though they get another fleet to Naf which is at minimum three turns. The attack on Burgundy keeping them honest nothing else currently for your armies to do and makes sure they don't try something. The east though..... As said all of this is a guess and the main thing you do NOT want is them force disbanding your armies for you prefer losing fleets then armies and it all being a guess with Budapest being a guaranteed loss, why try get out of there. My bet is that they cut Rum and do some form of an attack on Budapest, this moveset allows you to retreat your Bud army out to Rum.... HOWEVER it does rely on the fact that Ukraine makes it to Warsaw and they don't bounce you there and also a few other things to go right. As said THIS IS A GUESS I am just betting they will stack most things on Budapest. Whatever guess you take you CANNOT though not tap Warsaw and hope they don't walk in because that is a KEY center in your stalemate of the east to get the centers you need for the solo.\n\nAnyway keep me updated and I hope this helps.

                "body": "your line with France-Germany (from ENG to Mun) is [1,3,1,1,2] and their line with you (from BRE to TYR) is [2,1,4,1]. This notation just means I've counted up the number of enemy units on the border of each territory in the line. Eg Eng only touches Bre so it gets a 2, Pic touches Bre, Par and Bur so it gets a 3 and so on. The territories being represented are [Eng, Piic, Bel, Ruh, Mun] and [Bre, Par, Bur, Tyr] respectively. This line is unbreakable (excepting units moved into the theater from outside the section I'm considering). In particular, 1s can never be overrun because it takes 2 units to dislodge them but by definition there's no place for the 2nd unit to provide support from. Furthermore a support provided by a 1 is effectively unbreakable, as any unit moving to break support from the 1 is now one less unit which can participate in the attack on the thing the 1 is supporting. Based on this logic, there are certain unbreakable segments which I call \"words\". (1,3,1) is an unbreakable word, as if the two 1s support the neighboring 3 then the 3 has itself +2 supports, which is always enough to hold off any attack from its 3 neighboring enemies. Similarly, (1,2) is an unbreakable word as the 1 can support the 2 and thus the 2 always has enough support to hold off any attack from its neighbors. So your full line (broken down into words) can be written as [(1,3,1),(1,2)] and is thus sufficient to hold off any frontal attack in perpetuity.  \n\nThe enemy line can be broken down into either [(2),(1,4,1)] or [(2,1),(4,1)]. But these are not self sufficient arrangements. Meaning the unbreakable supports of the 1s in the line are not enough to hold off any possible attack. I call this a deficit. Eg the arrangement (2) has a deficit of 1, meaning a unit with two enemy neighbors and no other help costs +1 unit to sustain (in addition to itself). The support configuration (1,4,1) has the force of the unit itself + 2 unbreakable supports from the sides for a total defense of 3, up against an attack of possibly up to 4 neighbors. Therefore this configuration has a deficit of 4 - 3 = 1, meaning 1 additional unit from behind is needed to hold it against possible attacks. Continuing with this logic, the configuration (4,1) has a deficit of 2. Based on this calculation, breaking the enemy support strategies into either [(2),(1,4,1)] or [(2,1),(4,1)], the enemy has a net deficit of 2. Meaning they need a total of 2 additional units somewhere behind their line in order to hold off their position against you. I only count 1 unit behind the line able to provide that support (Mar). Therefore (on the part of the map I'm analyzing) the enemy has a net deficit of 1. \n\nWhat this means is the game is in a rock-paper-scissor state which favors you. You have two strategic choices.  \n\n1. You can use all 4 units to attack Bur, but if they pick the support arrangement [(2),(1,4,1)] and use Mar for support from behind then everything will bounce.\n\n2. You can attack Bre with Pic and Eng, but if the enemy picks the [(2,1),(4,1)]support arrangement then once again it will all bounce. \n\nSo its a coin flip that the enemy has to guess correctly each time otherwise they lose a territory. Based on this, they have an average of about one year (two coinflips) before on average they have guessed wrong once, after which it starts to snowball into a total victory for you, That said, beware the long tail of the Bernoulli distribution. \n\nWhat this means is, if they can't figure out how to leverage their Eastern front faster than two turns (on average) then you've probably won.  \n\nNote this type of analysis is meant for analyzing stalemate or near stalemate scenarios. If you are playing not just to hold a given line but to move it forward, then that also has a \"cost\" (the same way we talked about under supported configurations having a deficit). The cost can be interpreted the same way, its the number of units behind the line that would be needed to protect against possible counter-moves. \n\nIn other words, if a unit is expected to move then obviously it can no longer have its force counted towards the budget needed for holding the territory. This introduces a deficit in the budget that needs to be replaced. The amount of deficit present in a given scenario is proportional to the amount of risk, ie the fraction of potential strategies that will defeat your configuration of supports and moves. The net deficit of a given position translates into the fraction of scenarios which you can't simultaneously prepared for with a single strategy, which then translates into the bias of the \"coinflip\" each turn (really, its more like a strangely weighted rock paper scissors).\n\nAll this talk of coinflips, who ever said there's no such thing as luck in Diplomacy. ;)  \n\n(Hi Blake).\n\nHere's one possible plan:  \n\nIts Spring. Use this season to get a ship to MAO. Send ENG there so he can't break its support. Lon - Wal and Edi - Cly so you have convoy opportunities in the Fall. Pic - Bre to break support just in case which guarantees you make it to MAO. Nth - Lon and Hel to Nth just in case he accidentally slips into Eng (opening up Bre). If that happens then his ship is surrounded in Eng and you sink it like the Bismark. Once you own MAO and ENG (which may take up to a year to reach this position if they play optimal), you can convoy around the Iberian with impunity. You might lose PIC in the process, but you can rebuild it in the fall and you gain the use of two units stuck on the island not doing anything so the net effect is still a gain for you.   \n\nOk that's all I have time for. Remember, A convoy is not like a support, it is only broken if it is dislodged. Use that to your advantage. Britania rules the waves.",

F BOT S A Stp H will prevent Austria from ever breaking through in St Petersburg. In Ber/Mun, Germany needs to get one more army behind Munich so that they can put two support-holds on Munich and one on Berlin. All Germany needs to do to achieve that is to support Sil-Mun with Kie and Ber and move Munich to Ruhr. If Austria bounces Silesia out of Munich, Germany is currently playing down a unit, so they can build an army in Munich anyway. Either way, once Austria is in Tyr, Boh, Sil, and Pru, Germany holds the line with:\n\nA Mun H\nA Kie S A Mun H\nA Ruh S A Mun H\nA Ber H\nF BAL S A Mun H\n\nYour side of the line is a little trickier, but still manageable. Since you have so few units, you\u2019ll need German F NTH to move to ENG to help you hold MAO eventually. As for you, your units in Pie, Naf, and LYO are all across the line you want to hold. To avoid Austria disbanding another one of your units, which would be pretty disastrous here, you\u2019ll want to retreat your units behind Mar/Spa/MAO as quickly and safely as possible. One option is to move Pie - Mar, Mar - Gas, and support IRI - MAO. Then, in the fall, you\u2019ll want to move MAO to Portugal and have Naf backfill MAO supported by German F ENG. After that, you\u2019ll have a line:\n\nF MAO H\nF ENG S F MAO H\nF Spa H\nF Por S F Spa H\nA Mar H\nA Gas S A Mar H\n\nThe only issue with this is that if Austria has units in Pie, LYO, and WES in the fall, you\u2019ll have to guess over which of Mar/Spa Austria will attack and support the correct unit with Gascony. If Austria does anything else or you guess correctly with Gas, you\u2019ll have successfully formed an impenetrable stalemate line.",

Point out to Turkey that if they attack you, you'll collapse and England will win.\n\nEdit: just noticed E is going to take SPA too. You've got to work with Turkey to draw a tight stalemate line and you may have to accept Italy into the draw to prevent England from getting better positioned re: the Med. I was already assuming WME was going to kick SPA to let MAR hang on.",

It may require you to get cooperation from germany, and germany might take the opportunity to betray you, but this line of play is an option.\n\nYou definitely screwed up by not getting a single fleet in STP.\n\nIn general, you can kiss sweden, denmark, kiel and saint petersburg goodbye. You cannot keep them in the longterm, you can only lose them slowly. You can hold Berlin and Munich from land, but you have to take Munich RIGHT NOW. Even if you only 3 units on it. Maybe take italy into your plan.",
